I’m from Allentown, PA--made famous by the Billy Joel song and by hiding the Liberty Bell during the Revolutionary War. When Cory Steinle approached me about an idea that would turn into F.O.R.M.

As Vice President, I develop and oversee any legal proceedings of the organization, as well as serving as President when they are unable to.</p>

      <h5>Email: ers5430@psu.edu</h5>
      <p>I'm a second year Schreyer Honors Scholar at the Pennsylvania State University intending on majoring in Finance in the Smeal College of Business.I joined F.O.R.M. because college is already expensive enough as it is so I don't think students and/or their families should have to spend a fortune to get into the college of their dreams. I really enjoyed giving advice to my younger high school friends about applying to college so I knew F.O.R.M. was a great organization for me to join. s Education Chair, I host educational seminars for our consultants and create informative materials for our students by overseeing the F.O.R.M. blog.</p>
